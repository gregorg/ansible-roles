Some Ansible roles for marvelous playbooks
==========================================

About
-----

Some roles I use to setup small and medium servers, that you can add to your roles path.
I add them from my private repository, step by step, role by role, when I have time.

Compatibility
-------------

From squeeze to ... wheezy, but only Debian :)


How to use them
---------------

- clone this repo
- add the directory cloned to roles\_path in your ansible.cfg

Feel free to contribute, pull requests are welcome.

- Role 'mta' was forked from [HanXHX](https://github.com/HanXHX/my-ansible-playbooks/)'s playbooks.
